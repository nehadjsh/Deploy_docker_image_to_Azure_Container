### **Deploy docker image to Microsoft Azure Container**


Step by step deployed a web app named "agency" from end to end.


[Deploy the app "agency" to GitHub.](https://github.com/nehadjsh/Deploy_docker_image_to_Azure_Container/issues/1)

[Package and publish the app to the Docker hub and create continuous integration "CI" using Microsoft Azure.](https://github.com/nehadjsh/Deploy_docker_image_to_Azure_Container/issues/2)

[Deploy docker image to Microsoft Azure Container "CD".](https://github.com/nehadjsh/Deploy_docker_image_to_Azure_Container/issues/3)




I would to thank "Start Bootstrap " for the awesome apps, [Start Bootstrap's Github](https://github.com/StartBootstrap).
